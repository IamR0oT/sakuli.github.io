## Build Sustainable Tests

Sakuli uses state of the art web-testing technologies like Selenium, wraps a lot of standard functionalities and use-cases into user-friendly packages, thereby solving most of the pain points encountered by test designers in the past. With intelligent pattern and image matching, you won´t need to worry about every pixel. It was never easier to write sustainable user interface tests.

## Integrate UI Tests into CI/CD Pipelines

By integrating your Sakuli UI tests into continuous integration systems, you will speed up your software development cycles and increase the quality of your delivered software. Sakuli supports a variety of CI/CD tools like Jenkins, Drone IO, Travis-CI and many more.
